1.  Overview
    ========

    1.  Overall Objective and Basic Structure
        -------------------------------------

The Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) (Gilliam et al., 2005) is a
suite of software designed to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of
meteorological and air quality models. AMET matches the model output for
particular locations to the corresponding observed values from one or
more networks of monitors. These pairings of values (model and
observation) are then used to statistically and graphically analyze the
model’s performance.

More specifically, AMET is currently designed to analyze outputs from
the PSU/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5), the Weather Research and Forecasting
(WRF) model, and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, as
well as Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP)-postprocessed
meteorological data (surface only). The basic structure of AMET consists
of two *fields* and two *processes*.

-   The two fields (scientific topics) are **MET** and **AQ**,
    corresponding to meteorology and air quality data.

-   The two processes (actions) are **database population** and
    **analysis**. Database population refers to the underlying structure
    of AMET; after the observations and model data are paired in space
    and time, the pairs are inserted into a database (MySQL). Analysis
    refers to the statistical evaluation of these pairings and their
    subsequent plotting.

Practically, a user may be interested in using only one of the fields
(either MET or AQ), or may be interested in using both fields. That
decision is based on the scope of the study. The three main software
components of AMET are **MySQL** (an open-source database software
system), **R** (a free software environment for statistical computing
and graphics), and **perl** (an open-source cross-platform programming
language).

Concept of an AMET “Project”
----------------------------

A central organizing structure for AMET applications is a *project*. A
project groups a particular model simula­tion (specific model,
physics-set, spatial domain, grid scale, etc.) with all of the AMET
database tables that correspond to that simulation, the scripts
necessary to populate that database, and the scripts required to analyze
that project. For example, you might have one project for a 2002 36-km
continental U.S. simulation, and another project for a 2002 12-km
Eastern U.S. simulation. A project can be for either MET or AQ, not for
both. It is essential that you uniquely name each project. It is
recommended that you follow the directory structure when creating new
projects, by copying one of the three example directories (aqExample,
mm5Example, wrfExample) provided with the installation and then renaming
it to the new project’s name.

Organization of This User’s Guide
---------------------------------

The Community Modeling and Analysis System (CMAS) Center has created
this user’s guide to assist you in applying the AMET system in your
work. CMAS obtained the MET and AQ portions of AMET separately from EPA,
then integrated the two to create a consistent and integrated AMET
package that uses the UNIX C-shell interface to perform both MET and AQ
model evaluation and analyses. After this integra­tion, we tested the
integrated AMET package on multiple environments. After this
integration, we tested the integrated AMET package on multiple
environments.

Finally, we created this user’s guide. The contents of the remaining
sections are listed below.

-   Section 2 describes the overall directory structure of the
    > AMET installation.

-   Section 3 gives instructions on how to configure the Perl and R
    > configuration files.

-   In Section 4 is an overview of the various model outputs and
    > observed data provided with the AMET release.

-   Section 5 provides instructions on how to create the AMET MySQL
    > database, with specific instructions for each of the MET and
    > AQ models. Sample MySQL commands are also shown for illustrative
    > SQL queries.

-   Section 6 gives instructions on how to populate the AMET MySQL
    > database, with specific instructions for each of the MM5, WRF,
    > MCIP, and CMAQ models, and also on how to create a new MET project
    > and a new AQ project for subsequent analyses.

-   In Section 7 are instructions on how to perform model evaluation for
    > each of the WRF and CMAQ models, and includes an overview of the
    > functionality of all the MET and AQ evaluation scripts provided.  
    > ***<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Important
    > note</span>:*** *The set of analyses/evaluation scripts provided
    > in this release are strictly for illustration purposes on the
    > functionality/design of AMET, and are not to be construed as a
    > recommended suite of analyses scripts for model evaluation. We
    > encourage the user community to use the scripts we have provided
    > as examples as well as a basis to start developing other analyses
    > scripts and contribute them to the modeling community to increase
    > AMET functionality.*

-   Section 8 discusses how to obtain support for AMET from the
    > Community Modeling and Analysis System (CMAS) Center
    > ([**http://www.cmascenter.org**](http://www.cmascenter.org)).

-   In Appendix A is an overall flow diagram for AMET and its
    > various components.

-   Appendix B provides information on the various input files used
    > in AMET. For each input file, a table lists brief descriptions of
    > all user-defined variables that can be set by the user for a
    > given evaluation.

Before using AMET and this user’s guide, you must first install the AMET
package on your system. For information on the installation process,
please see the separate *Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET)
Installation Guide* that can be downloaded from the CMAS web site.

Directory Structure
===================

In our discussions, we refer to the top of the AMET directory structure
as “$AMETBASE”. This environment variable is actually set in many of the
scripts discussed below. For example, if you had untarred AMET’s tarball
in your home directory, then AMETBASE would be ~/AMET.

Under $AMETBASE are the directories shown in Table 2-1.

<span id="_Toc190070890" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc199840991"
class="anchor"></span></span>Table ‑1. Directories under $AMETBASE.

| **Directory**         | **Description**                                                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **bin**               | External executables used by helper scripts.                          |

                         (contains field-specific \[i.e., MET and AQ\] subdirectories).         |
| **obs**               | Observational data (e.g., MADIS, discussed in Section 4.2)            
                         (contains field-specific \[i.e., MET and AQ\] subdirectories).         |
| **output**            | Output of database population and analysis                            
                         (contains project-specific subdirectories).                            |
| **perl**              | Perl scripts used primarily for database population.                  |

| **scripts\_analysis** | Project-specific wrapper scripts and inputs for analysis              
                         (contains project-specific subdirectories).                            |
| **scripts\_db**       | Project-specific wrapper scripts and inputs for database population   
                         (contains project-specific subdirectories).                            |
| **src**               | Source code for third-party software.                                 |

*Note:* For large model outputs and for MADIS observations that cover a
long period of time, it may be prudent to link these data within the
appropriate AMET directories rather than moving or copying them.

Configuration
=============

After untarring the AMET code and data and installing/building the
required three tiers of software components (as discussed in the AMET
installation guide referenced above), the next stage is to configure the
AMET system. In the $AMETBASE/configure directory, you will find five
files:

-   A perl configuration file (amet-config.pl).

-   An R configuration file (amet-config.R).

-   Three Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS)
    > configuration files (MET\_matching.conf, MET\_matching.MCIP.conf,
    > and MET\_matching\_nonPX.conf). These configuration files describe
    > how MADIS variables “match” (map or translate to) various MET
    > model variables. Most users will not need to change these variable
    > mapping files, so they are not discussed further in this guide.
    > For the AQ side, the matching of variables between model output
    > and observations is project specific. See Section 6.5, “Creating a
    > New AQ Project,” for more details on changing the default mapping
    > of AQ observations to model variables.

    1.  Perl Configuration File (amet-config.pl)
        ----------------------------------------

The Perl configuration file is used by the underlying Perl programs to
populate the database with the data pairs created by AMET’s matching of
model output for particular locations to corre­spon­ding observed values
(these data pairs are referred to in this document as “model-obs
pairs”). Most users will need to modify only a few specific lines of
this configuration file. The most com­mon variables to change are shown
in Table 3-1; a full description can be found in Appendix B.1.

<span id="_Toc199840992" class="anchor"></span>Table ‑. Most common
variables that need to be changed in amet-config.pl.

| **Variable**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **$mysql\_server**             | The MySQL server location. Examples are **localhost** if MySQL is installed on the same machine on which you have installed AMET, or **rama.cempd.unc.edu** if you have installed the MySQL server on a remote host called **rama**.                                                              |
| **$root\_pass**                | Password for **ametsecure**, or your **$root\_login** (if you changed it from "**ametsecure**"). This MySQL user will be created later when you are working through Section 5. To provide additional security, AMET is shipped with permissions that allow this file to be read only by the user. |
| **$perl\_lib**                 | Location of additional Perl libraries. In our testing, we added additional libraries through the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) to **/usr/local/lib/perl**. Below that is the version number directory, and below that are the additional modules.                                     |
| **$R\_lib**                    | All of the R library paths that should be searched by the R scripts. In our installation, they are **/usr/local/pkgs/Rpackages:$R\_dir/lib/R/site-library**, since we installed additional R libraries under **/usr/local/pkgs/Rpackages**.                                                       |

| **$login\_madis<sup>1</sup>**  | MADIS-provided login.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **$pass\_madis<sup>1</sup>**   | MADIS-provided password.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **$pass\_ncep<sup>1</sup>**    | Anonymous password for the [National Centers for Environmental Prediction](http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/) (NCEP); this is usually your e-mail address. Note the necessary "\\@".                                                                                                                      |

R Configuration File (amet-config.R)
------------------------------------

The R configuration file is used by the underlying R programs to perform
statistical analysis on your model-obs pairs. Most users will need to
modify only a few specific lines of this configura­tion file. The most
common variables to change are shown in Table 3-2.

<span id="_Toc199840993" class="anchor"></span>Table ‑. Most common
variables that need to be changed in amet-config.R.

| **Variable**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **server**     | The MySQL server location. Examples are **localhost** if MySQL is installed on the same machine on which you have installed AMET, or **rama.cempd.unc.edu** if you have installed the MySQL server on a remote host called **rama**.                                                                                                                                             |
| **passwd**     | Password for **ametsecure**, or your **login** (if you changed it from "**ametsecure**"). This MySQL user will be created later when you are working through Section 5. To provide additional security, AMET is shipped with permissions that allow this file to be read only by the user. *Note*: The R and perl configuration files should have matching passwords and logins. |
| **newLibPath** | Should include all R library paths where R packages were installed. In our installation, they are: **c(“/usr/local/pkgs/Rpackages”,oldLibPath)**, since we installed additional R libraries under **/usr/local/pkgs/Rpackages**. *Note:* The **oldLibPath** needs to be included in this variable.                                                                               |

Datasets
========

The AMET release includes both model and observational datasets provided
as examples. You should have downloaded these into the proper
directories during the installation process.

Model Data
----------

For the model data, we have included both meteorological and air quality
data. We have organized the data into four example projects:
"mm5Example", "wrfExample", "mcipExample", and "aqExample". On the MET
side, there is a 5-day MM5 simulation (July 04 2002 00:00 UTC to July 08
2002 23:00 UTC), a 5‑day WRF simulation (July 05 2002 00:00 UTC to July
09 2002 23:00 UTC), and a 5-day MCIP-postprocessed MM5 simulation (July
05 2002 00:00 UTC to July 09 2002 23:00 UTC). The MM5 data file is

> $AMETBASE/model\_data/MET/**mm5Example**/MMOUT\_DOMAIN1\_02Jul04

Note that we have bolded “mm5Example” in the directory name above to
highlight the fact that we are using the project name to organize the
model output files into directories.

The WRF data consist of five WRF output files in netCDF format:

> $AMETBASE/model\_data/MET/**wrfExample**/
>
> wrfout\_d01\_2002-07-05\_00:00:00
>
> wrfout\_d01\_2002-07-06\_00:00:00
>
> wrfout\_d01\_2002-07-07\_00:00:00
>
> wrfout\_d01\_2002-07-08\_00:00:00
>
> wrfout\_d01\_2002-07-09\_00:00:00

The MCIP data consist of five METCRO2D files and one GRIDCRO2D file in
netCDF format:

$AMETBASE/model\_data/MET/mcipExample/

GRIDCRO2D\_2002187

METCRO2D\_2002186

METCRO2D\_2002187

METCRO2D\_2002188

METCRO2D\_2002189

METCRO2D\_2002190

On the AQ side, we have included two CMAQ output files for the period
July 01 2002 0:00 UTC to July 11 2002 00:00 UTC. The two files:

> $AMETBASE/model\_data/AQ/**aqExample**/
>
> test.36km.conc
>
> test.36km.dep

correspond to the concentration and wet deposition output files from
CMAQ, after they have been postprocessed with the combine utility.

All of the spatial domains cover the continental U.S. and have a 36-km
grid resolution.

Observational Data
------------------

As with the model data, the observations directory structure is divided
between MET and AQ fields. On the MET side, all of the observations come
from the Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS),
provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
If you are going to use AMET for MET analysis, you must first contact
MADIS to obtain a MADIS account, login, and password (see
[**http://www-sdd.fsl.noaa.gov/MADIS**](http://www-sdd.fsl.noaa.gov/MADIS)
for details). You will use this login information in setting up the Perl
configuration file (discussed in Section 3.1).

In the AMET structure, all of the MADIS data are stored under
$AMETBASE/obs/MET. The file stations.csv is a metadata file that
describes the station ID and location of each of the MADIS monitoring
sites; this file is in comma-separated-value (.csv) format. The AMET
distribution from CMAS will not include any MET observations from MADIS.
When you run the database population scripts (Section 6), they will
automatically call the MADIS system to download the available monitoring
sites’ observations for the specified time period via ftp. For example,
the radiosonde data will be downloaded to

> $AMETBASE/obs/MET/point/raob/netcdf

Each of the observation files is a netCDF file representing one hour’s
worth of data from all available monitoring sites. The netCDF file can
be stored in a gzip compressed format to save space, and unzipped
automatically as needed. Note that the default settings for the MADIS
obs extraction are set in template files in $AMETBASE/bin/madis\_input.
You can modify these template files to extract mesonet data if desired.
Also, you can adjust the quality control level from its current highest
level. See the MADIS documentation available from their web site for
more information on how to customize these template files.

On the AQ side, we have included the observational data for the
following networks: Air Quality System (AQS) network, Clean Air Status

Environments (IMPROVE) network, Mercury Deposition Network (MDN),

preprocessed and reformatted (in some instances from their original
sources) for access by AMET. The temporal range is network dependent,
and ranges from 2001 to 2006. The monitoring station locations are
provided by a series of .csv files under the subdirectory
$AMETBASE/obs/AQ/site\_lists. A brief synopsis of each network, along
with the steps taken to create these data for AMET, is given below. Note
that in the species lists, each line is of the format “observed species
name; model species name (units)”.

Database Setup
==============

The next step in using AMET is to set up the MySQL database. Please
refer to the flow diagram in Appendix A to understand the overall flow
of data among the various modules within AMET. This section must be
completed before you populate the database with your project-specific
data (Section 6). This setup process is required only once for a given
AMET installation. There are separate setup procedures for the two
fields, MET and AQ. If you are using AMET for only one of those fields,
you need to run only the corresponding setup. If you are running AMET
for both fields, you will need to run both setups. In the following
discussion, we assume the default name of the AMET database, “amet”, and
the default AMET MySQL user, “ametsecure”. If you decide to change
either of these, then you will need to update the appropriate variables
in the Perl and R configuration files in the directory
$AMETBASE/configure (see Section 3). Before you run the setup scripts,
you will need to know the “root” password for the MySQL admini­strator.
Note that this is not the same as the “ametsecure” password that will be
created using the scripts discussed below.

MET Setup
---------

Go to the setup directory

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db/setupMET

Here, you will see a series of C-shell scripts (.csh) and an input file
(.input). The input file, sites\_meta.input, defines the metadata file
for the MADIS stations (station ID, location, etc.).

To initialize the MET side of AMET, you will need to edit and run the
initialize\_met\_db.csh script. Specifically, you should make sure the
value of AMETBASE corresponds to your system. If you have already run
the setup procedure for AQ, you should set the variable “new\_db” to
“N”; otherwise set it to “Y” to create a new amet database. Run the
initialize script

> $ ./initialize\_met\_db.csh

This will ask you for MySQL’s “root” password. It will then set up the
AMET database, “amet”, and the AMET user, “ametsecure”. It will also
create two tables in your amet database: stations (observation sites
metadata) and project\_log (contains summary information for each MET
project).

The setup directory also contains scripts for removing projects and
removing the amet database. To delete a specific MET project, use

> $./delete\_project.csh

This script will ask you for the name of the project to delete.
**CAUTION:** This will delete all of the tables in the database
corresponding to that project.

To delete the amet database from MySQL, use

> $./delete\_db.csh

This script will ask you for the MySQL “root” password before
proceeding. *Use this script with **EXTREME CAUTION** because this will
delete all of the data in the database corresponding to **all** of the
projects (**both MET and AQ**).*

AQ Setup
--------

Go to the setup directory

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db/setupAQ

As for the MET setup, you will see a series of C-shell scripts and an
input file. The input file, sites\_meta.input, defines the metadata
files for the various AQ monitoring networks (station ID, location,
etc.).

To initialize the AQ side of AMET, you will need to edit and run the
initialize\_aq\_db.csh script. Specifically, you should make sure the
value of AMETBASE corresponds to your system. If you have already run
the setup procedure for MET, you should set the variable “new\_db” to
“N”; otherwise set it to “Y” to create a new amet database. Run the
initialize script

> $ ./initialize\_aq\_db.csh

This will ask you for MySQL’s “root” password. It will then set up the
AMET database, “amet”, and the AMET user, “ametsecure”. It will also
create three tables in your amet database: site\_metadata (observation
sites metadata), project\_units (contains species-specific units for
each project), and aq\_project\_log (contains summary information for
each AQ project).

The setup directory also contains scripts for removing projects and
removing the amet database. To delete a specific MET project, use

> $./delete\_project.csh

This script will ask you for the name of the project to delete.
**CAUTION:** This will delete all of the tables in the database
corresponding to that project.

To delete the amet database from MySQL, use

> $./delete\_db.csh

This script will ask you for the MySQL “root” password before
proceeding. *Use this script with **EXTREME CAUTION** because this will
delete all of the data in the database corresponding to **all** of the
projects (**both MET and AQ**).*

Basic MySQL Commands
--------------------

As you begin to go through the amet database setup and the
project-specific database populate process, you may want to query the
database directly to see your progress. Here are a few commands to help
you interact directly with the MySQL amet database. For more specifics,
see one of the many MySQL books available, or look at the documentation
under

> [**http://dev.mysql.com/doc**](http://dev.mysql.com/doc)

To log onto the MySQL server from the command line, type

> $ mysql -u ametsecure -D amet –p

This will give you a MySQL prompt (“mysql&gt;“). Note that all MySQL
commands are case insensitive, and they must end with a semicolon (“;”).

To get a list of all the tables in your database, type

> mysql&gt; show tables;

After you have populated all of the example projects (end of Section 6),
that command will yield a table like this:

> +---------------------+
>
> | Tables\_in\_amet |
>
> +---------------------+
>
> | aqExample |
>
> | aq\_project\_log |
>
> | mm5Example\_profiler |
>
> | mm5Example\_raob |
>
> | mm5Example\_surface |
>
> | mcipExample\_profiler|
>
> | mcipExample\_raob |
>
> | mcipExample\_surface |
>
> | project\_log |
>
> | project\_units |
>
> | site\_metadata |
>
> | stations |
>
> | wrfExample\_profiler |
>
> | wrfExample\_raob |
>
> | wrfExample\_surface |
>
> +---------------------+

To select every column and row in your project\_log table:

> mysql&gt; select \* from project\_log;

To select the latitude, longitude, and common name columns from the
stations metadata table and limit the results to the first 20 rows:

> mysql&gt; select lat,lon,common\_name from stations limit 20;

To select all station metadata where the monitor is from the CASTNET
network:

> mysql&gt; select \* from site\_metadata where network=‘castnet’;

To determine which networks are included in the aqExample project:

> mysql&gt; select distinct network from aqExample;

Database Population
===================

The database population phase of AMET must be performed for each new
project. As discussed in Section 1.2, the *project* is the organizing
structure that we use to group a particular model simula­tion with the
scripts and data used to populate the amet tables. If you go to the
database populate directory by typing

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db

you will see four project directories, in addition to the setup
directories described earlier. The projects are

1.  a MET example for the WRF model (wrfExample),

2.  a MET example for the MM5 model (mm5Example),

3.  a MET example for MCIP postprocessed surface data (mcipExample), and

4.  an AQ example for the CMAQ model (aqExample).

In the following subsections, we describe how to run each project.

The wrfExample Project
----------------------

Go to the project directory

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db/wrfExample

Here, you will see two input files and two C-shell scripts. The
setup\_project.input file is the input file for initializing the
project’s database tables (discussed later in Section 6). The only thing
you should need to change in this file is the “$email” variable. Note
that you should use the backslash “escape” character, “\\”, to prevent
Perl from evaluating the “@” in your e-mail address. The
populate\_project.input file describes specific flags for the model
outputs and observations that you want to process. See Appendix B for
information on the specifics relating to each variable. You will likely
not need to change anything in this second input file.

The C-shell file metProject.csh is a wrapper script for calling the Perl
programs that actually populate the AMET database with the project data.
You will likely only need to verify that the variable AMETBASE has been
updated for this project. Run the script by typing

> $ ./metProject.csh &gt;& log.populate

This C-shell script will create three empty project tables in the AMET
database: wrfExample\_profiler, wrfExample\_raob, and
wrfExample\_surface. These tables correspond to the matches between the
model outputs and (1) the wind profiler observations, (2) the radiosonde
observations, and (3) the surface observations. After creating these
tables, the script then begins the matching process. This consists of
auto-ftp-ing data from the MADIS web site for the model’s temporal
period, unzipping the downloaded data, finding the geographic location
of each observation site on the model grid and interpolating to those
locations, populating the appropriate table with the model-obs pairs for
each variable, and optionally rezipping the data for compressed storage.
Finally, the script updates the project\_log with summary information
for the wrfExample project.

The second C-shell file, metFTP.csh, is a wrapper script for calling
Perl programs to download observational data from MADIS for a specific
period of time. This allows you to download observational data without
having the model output. Make sure the variable auto\_ftp is set to 1
when running this script. Please note that the MADIS data need to be
downloaded once for a given time period and will subsequently be
available to all projects.

The mm5Example Project
----------------------

Go to the project directory:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db/mm5Example

Here, you will see two input files and two C-shell scripts. The
setup\_project.input file is the input file for initializing the
project’s database tables (discussed later in Section 6). The only thing
you should need to change in this file is the “$email” variable. Note
that you should use the backslash “escape” character, “\\”, to prevent
Perl from evaluating the “@” in your e-mail address. The
populate\_project.input file describes specific flags for the model
outputs and observations that you want to process. See Appendix B for
information on the specifics relating to each variable. You will likely
not need to change anything in this second input file. Note that the MM5
model has been run with the Pleim-Xiu (PX) surface model and has the
relevant flags for this configuration; see Appendix B for more
information.

The C-shell file metProject.csh is a wrapper script for calling the Perl
programs that actually populate the AMET database with the project data.
You will likely only need to verify that the variable AMETBASE has been
updated for this project. Run the script by typing

> $ ./metProject.csh &gt;& log.populate

This C-shell script will create three empty project tables in the AMET
database: mm5Example\_profiler, mm5Example\_raob, and
mm5Example\_surface. These tables correspond to the matches between the
model outputs and (1) the wind profiler observations, (2) the radiosonde
observations, and (3) the surface observations. After creating these
tables, the script then begins the matching process. This consists of
converting the MM5 output file into a netCDF file, auto-ftp-ing data
from the MADIS web site for the model’s temporal period, unzipping the
downloaded data, finding the geographic location of each observation
site on the model grid and interpolating to those locations, populating
the appropriate table with the model-obs pairs for each variable, and
optionally rezipping the data for compressed storage. Finally, the
script updates the project\_log with summary information for the
mm5Example project.

Note that if your MM5 simulation was configured to use a non-PX surface
model, you will need to change the two variables $diagnose\_sfc and
$match\_config in the populate\_project.input file; see Appendix B for
more information.

The second C-shell file, metFTP.csh, is a wrapper script for calling
Perl programs to download observational data from MADIS for a specific
period of time. This allows you to download observational data without
having the model output. Make sure that the variable auto\_ftp is set to
1 when running this script. Please note that the MADIS data need to be
downloaded only once for a given time period and will subsequently be
available to all projects.

The mcipExample Project
-----------------------

Go to the project directory

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db/mcipExample

Here, you will see two input files and two C-shell scripts. The
setup\_project.input file is the input file for initializing the
project’s database tables (discussed later in Section 6). The only thing
you should need to change in this file is the “$email” variable. Note
that you should use the backslash “escape” character, “\\”, to prevent
Perl from evaluating the “@” in your e-mail address. The
populate\_project.input file describes specific flags for the model
outputs and observations that you want to process. See Appendix B for
information on the specifics relating to each variable. You will likely
not need to change anything in this second input file.

The C-shell file metProject.csh is a wrapper script for calling the Perl
programs that actually populate the AMET database with the project data.
You will likely only need to verify the variable AMETBASE has been
updated for this project. Also note the variable AMET\_MCIP\_GRID, which
should provide the full path to the GRIDCRO2D file used for this
project. Run the script by typing

> $ ./metProject.csh &gt;& log.populate

This C-shell script will create three empty project tables in the AMET
database: mcipExample\_profiler, mcipExample\_raob, and
mcipExample\_surface. These tables correspond to the matches between the
model outputs and (1) the wind profiler observations, (2) the radiosonde
observations, and (3) the surface observations. However, AMET currently
works only on MCIP surface data, so the profiler and raob tables will be
empty. After creating these tables, the script then begins the matching
process. This consists of auto-ftp-ing data from the MADIS web site for
the model's temporal period, unzipping the downloaded data, finding the
geographic location of each observation site on the model grid and
interpolating to those locations, populating the appropriate table with
the model-obs pairs for each variable, and optionally rezipping the data
for compressed storage. Finally, the script updates the project\_log
with summary information for the mcipExample project.

The second C-shell file, metFTP.csh, is a wrapper script for calling
Perl programs to download observational data from MADIS for a specific
period of time. This allows you to download observational data without
having the model output. Make sure the variable auto\_ftp is set to 1
when running this script. Please note that the MADIS data need to be
downloaded only once for a given time period and will subsequently be
available to all projects.

The aqExample Project
---------------------

Go to the project directory:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db/aqExample

Here, you will see two input files, one C-shell script, and the combine
subdirectory. The setup\_project.input file is the input file for
initializing the project’s database table (discussed later in Section
6). The only thing you should need to change in this file is the
“$email” variable. Note that you should use the backslash “escape”
character, “\\”, to prevent Perl from evaluating the “@” in your e-mail
address. The populate\_project.input file describes specific flags for
the model outputs and observations that you want to process. See
Appendix B for information on the specifics relating to each variable.
You will likely not need to change anything in this second input file.
The combine subdirectory is not used for this example; it is discussed
later in Section 6.5, “Creating a New AQ Project”.

The C-shell file aqProject.csh is a wrapper script for calling the Perl
programs that actually populate the AMET database with the project data.
The variable that you will likely need to change for this project is
“AMETBASE”. Run the script by typing

> $ ./aqProject.csh &gt;& log.populate

Note that if you are overwriting an existing project (i.e., using the
same project name), you cannot redirect the screen output to a file
because the script will require input from you.

This C-shell script will create one empty project table in the AMET
database: aqExample. After creating this table, the script then begins
the matching process. This consists of calling a series of Perl programs
and Fortran helper programs. The two Fortran helper programs are
$AMETBASE/bin/cmp\_airs.exe and $AMETBASE/bin/sitecmp.exe; the first one
matches the AQS network’s data to the nearest grid cell in the CMAQ
model, and the second one does the same for the other networks. After
each network has been matched to the model, the aqExample table is
populated with the model-obs pairs. In addition to creating and
populating the aqExample table, the script updates the project\_units
table with each network for that project. This table defines the
physical units of the species variables for this network (e.g., ppb vs.
µg/m<sup>3</sup>). Finally, the script updates the aq\_project\_log with
summary information for the aqExample project.

Creating a New MET Project
--------------------------

When you create your own projects, we recommend that you utilize the
structure of naming your directories after your projects. If you choose
not to do this, you will have to modify the provided run scripts.

To create a new project, follow these basic steps:

1.  Copy the appropriate example project to a new directory.

2.  Rename it after your new project (use the *exact* project name, as
    many scripts use the project name to navigate directories).

3.  Create a new project directory under $AMETBASE/model\_data/MET for
    the input model data.

4.  Change the appropriate variables in the project C-shell script.

5.  Run your new populate script.

For example, if we were creating a new WRF project called “wrfNC2007”,
we would use

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db
>
> $ cp -r wrfExample wrfNC2007
>
> $ cd wrfNC2007

Create a new model data directory and move or link your model data into
it, as follows:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/model\_data/MET
>
> $ mkdir wrfNC2007
>
> $ cd wrfNC2007
>
> $ ln -s &lt;model data&gt; .

Here, you would replace “&lt;model data&gt;” with the path to your model
data file(s). The metProject.csh script will perform the model-obs
matching on all model outputs in this new directory.

Next, edit the $AMETBASE/script\_db/wrfNC2007/metProject.csh variables
AMET\_PROJECT ("wrfNC2007") and AMET\_PROJ\_DESC (your description of
the project).

Finally, run the populate script:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db/wrfNC2007
>
> $ ./metProject.csh

This will create a new MET project in the amet database. Specifically,
it will create a new row in your project\_log table and three new
tables: wrfNC2007\_profiler, wrfNC2007\_raob, and wrfNC2007\_surface.

Creating a New AQ Project
-------------------------

Before describing the creation of a new AQ project, we need to clarify a
potentially confusing issue: the relationship between model species and
monitor species. In order for AQ database population to work, there must
be a mapping between the model species and the various network species.
This mapping is accomplished by postprocessing the CMAQ model data, and
through species definitions in the populate\_project.input file. The
model data used in the aqExample section (Section 6.3) were already
postprocessed, so we did not need to go through that step when running
the example project. In a new project, you will likely need to
postprocess your CMAQ data before they are ingested into the amet
database. This postprocessing is accomplished in the third step of
creating a new AQ project (described below), using the combine Fortran
program.

Also, when you create your own projects, we recommend that you utilize
the structure of naming your directories after your projects. If you
choose not to do this, you will have to modify the provided run scripts.

To create a new project, follow these basic steps:

1.  Copy the appropriate example project to a new directory.

2.  Rename it after your new project (use the *exact* project name).

3.  Postprocess the model data using the combine Fortran program.

4.  Create a new project directory under $AMETBASE/model\_data/AQ for
    the input model data.

5.  Change the appropriate variables in the project C-shell script.

6.  Run the new populate script.

For example, if we were creating a new AQ project called “aqNC2007”, we
would use

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db
>
> $ cp -r aqExample aqNC2007

Next you will need to postprocess the raw CMAQ concentration and wet
deposition files to map the data to the appropriate species names. To do
this, you will use the combine Fortran program. Go to the combine
directory:

> $ cd aqNC2007/combine

Edit the combine\_conc.csh and combine\_dep.csh scripts for your model
data. For detailed instructions on combine, see
[**http://www.cmascenter.org/help/model\_docs/cmaq/4.6/EVALUATION\_TOOLS.txt**](http://www.cmascenter.org/help/model_docs/cmaq/4.6/EVALUATION_TOOLS.txt).
Run the two combine scripts:

> $ ./combine\_conc.csh
>
> $ ./combine\_dep.csh

Regarding the populate\_project.input file, you will not need to change
it if you do not change the species definition files (spec\_def\*). If
you do change the species definitions, you will need to change the
species definitions and names in the
$AMETBASE/scripts\_db/aqNC2007/populate\_project.input. See Appendix B
for details.

Next, create a new model data directory and move or link your
postprocessed model data into it, as follows:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/model\_data/AQ
>
> $ mkdir aqNC2007
>
> $ cd aqNC2007
>
> $ ln -s &lt;model data&gt; .

Here, you would replace “&lt;model data&gt;” with the path to your
postprocessed model data file(s).

Next, in the file $AMETBASE/scripts\_db/aqNC2007/aqProject.csh, edit the
variables AMET\_PROJECT ("aqNC2007"), START\_DATE (start date of the
model data), END\_DATE (end date of the model data), CONC\_1 (model
concentration file(s)), and DEP\_1 (model deposition file(s)). Note that
the model data files should point to your postprocessed model data.

Finally, run the populate script:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_db/aqNC2007
>
> $ ./aqProject.csh

This will create a new AQ project in the amet database. Specifically, it
will create a new row in your aq\_project\_log table, a series of new
rows (one for each network) in your project\_units table, and a new
project table: aqNC2007.

Analysis
========

The analysis phase of AMET consists of performing statistical analyses
on the model-obs pairs and creating plots of the resulting statistics.
The basic process is to query the project’s database table(s) using a
set of SQL criteria; to perform statistical analyses on the returned
data; and to create plots, tables, and text file outputs. The current
AMET package contains a series of preprogrammed statistical analysis and
plotting routines, based on the R language. These scripts are provided
strictly as a starting point and as illustrative examples. Because all
the model-obs pairs are stored in a MySQL database, an advanced user can
decide to access those data in any desired manner, including other
software packages. All that is required is a MySQL interface and some
exploration of the table structure. We encourage advanced users to
extend these R scripts to create more specific or advanced plotting
capabilities, to use other languages to expand AMET analysis
capabilities, and to contribute these updates to the CMAS community.

As with the database populate phase, the project is the organizing
structure that we use to group a particular model run (specific model,
physics or chemistry, spatial domain, scale, etc.) with the scripts used
to analyze the amet tables and with the output from this analysis (plots
and data).

A second organizing structure is the grouping of three files for each
type of analysis. In the project directories, you will see a C-shell
script and an input file with similar names (e.g., run\_timeseries.csh
and timeseries.input). These two files set up everything that is
necessary to run an underlying R script in $AMETBASE/R and then they run
that script. The use of the C-shell interface allows users who are not
very familiar with R to perform these predefined analyses, shielding
them from the actual R code.

wrfExample
----------

Go to the project directory:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_analysis/wrfExample

Here, you will see a series of C-shell scripts and their accompanying
input files. We will go through an analysis script in detail as an
example for running each of the scripts in the project.

The run\_spatial\_surface.csh script creates a series of maps comparing
the surface monitors to the model for one or more days. Each plot
provides color-coded model performance metrics at each of the monitor
locations. In each map, it plots the particular value at the monitor
location.

First, edit the run\_spatial\_surface.csh file. Change the AMETBASE
variable to correspond with your setup. The corresponding input file,
spatial\_surface.input, will likely not need to be changed.

Run the script:

> $ ./run\_spatial\_surface.csh

This will run the script and print out the location of the plots. In
addition to the script outputs, a detailed log file is produced and
located in the directory $AMETBASE/scripts\_analysis/wrfExample. After
the script has completed, go to the output directory and view your maps:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/output/wrfExample/spatial\_surface

You should see a whole series of plots of the form:

> wrfExample.&lt;stats&gt;.&lt;variable&gt;.20020705.20020709.pdf

Under the $AMETBASE/scripts\_analysis directory, you will notice that
there is only a wrfExample project on the MET side. We did not include
the mm5Example project nor the mcipExample project because the different
inputs are basically treated the same in terms of analysis. You could
easily add a new project directory for mm5Example or mcipExample by
following the instructions in Section 7.3.

aqExample
---------

Go to the project directory:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_analysis/aqExample

Here, you will see a series of C-shell scripts and their accompanying
input files. We will go through an analysis script in detail as a
example for running each of the scripts in the project.

The run\_scatterplot.csh script creates a scatterplot for one species
from one or more monitoring networks. It compares the observed values to
the corresponding model values. The AQ side has an added complication:
not all monitoring networks monitor all species. Therefore, the user
needs to know which network(s) has the species of interest; if that
species is not available in the network(s) specified, the analysis
scripts will likely fail. See Section 4.2 and Appendix B for more
details on the various species that are monitored (or available) from
each AQ network.

First, edit the run\_scatterplot.csh file. Change the AMETBASE variable
to correspond with your setup. Note that the species selected is SO4 and
you are plotting two networks: IMPROVE and CASTNET. The corresponding
input file, scatterplot.input, will likely not need to be changed.

Also note that all AQ analysis scripts make use of the Network.input
input file. This file contains information about each observational
network available to the project that is needed by the R scripts. More
information about this file can be found in Appendix B, Table B-13.

Run the script:

> $ ./run\_scatterplot.csh

This will run the script and print out the location of the plots. In
addition to the script outputs, a detailed log file is produced and
located in the directory $AMETBASE/scripts\_analysis/aqExample. After
the script has completed, go to the output directory and view your
plots:

> $ cd $AMETBASE/output/aqExample/scatterplot

You should see files of the form:

> aqExample\_SO4\_scatterplot.pdf

A brief summary of each of the C-shell scripts is given in Table 7-2.

Creating a New Analysis Project
-------------------------------

Creating a new analysis project requires the same basic steps for both
the MET and the AQ models. When you create your own analysis projects,
we recommend that you utilize the structure of naming your directories
after your projects (described earlier). To run analyses, you must
already have populated the database with the new project (see Sections
6.4 and 6.5). To create a new analysis project, follow these basic
steps:

1.  Copy the appropriate example project to a new directory.

2.  Rename it after your new project (use the *exact* project name, as
    > many scripts use the project name to navigate directories).

3.  Change the appropriate variables in the project C-shell scripts.

4.  Run the new analysis scripts.

For example, if we were creating a new WRF project called “wrfNC2007”,
we would use

> $ cd $AMETBASE/scripts\_analysis
>
> $ cp -r wrfExample wrfNC2007
>
> $ cd wrfNC2007

In each of the C-shell scripts you want to run, make sure to change the
AMET\_PROJECT to wrfNC2007. You will also likely change dates and custom
titles in many of the scripts.

Run the desired analysis scripts from your new project directory.

CMAS Support for AMET
=====================

We have added AMET to Bugzilla, the CMAS bug-tracking and support
request software system. You are encouraged to contact CMAS via bugzilla
if you have bugs to report, or if you would like assistance with a
specific component of AMET. The Bugzilla site for AMET is
[**http://bugz.unc.edu/enter\_bug.cgi?product=AMET**](http://bugz.unc.edu/enter_bug.cgi?product=AMET).
If you have never accessed this site before, a user account needs to be
created by sending an email request to the CMAS administrator. We have
created the following subsections on the Bugzilla AMET page:

-   AQ Analyses

-   AQ Database

-   Installation

-   Met Analyses

-   Met Database

-   Other

**Appendix B:  
Configuration and Input Files**

1.  Perl Configuration File

This is the configuration file for all Perl scripts used in database
population—for example, $AMETBASE/configure/amet-config.pl.

<span id="_Toc199840996" class="anchor"></span>Table B‑. amet-config.pl

| **Variable**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **$amet\_base**    | Top of AMET directory tree. It is recommended that you keep this as the value of the environmental variable **$AMETBASE**. If you use something else, the provided scripts will need significant modification.                                                               |
| **$mysql\_server** | MySQL server location. Examples are “**localhost**” for the same machine as AMET, or “**rama.cempd.unc.edu**” for a server on rama.                                                                                                                                          |
| **$root\_login**   | MySQL user for adding data to the database and performing queries. “**ametsecure**” is recommended. This user will be created in the database setup. *Note:* To increase system security, users may want to restrict this configuration file to read and write only by user. |
| **$root\_pass**    | Password for “**ametsecure**”, or your **$root\_login** (if changed from “**ametsecure**”). This user will be created in the database setup.                                                                                                                                 |
| **$dbase**         | The name of the MySQL database created for all AMET projects. “**amet**” is recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **$perl\_lib**     | Location of additional Perl libraries. In our example, we added additional libraries through CPAN to “**/usr/local/lib/perl**”. Below **$perl\_lib** is the version number directory and below that are the additional modules.                                              |

| **maxrec**     | Maximum number of records to extract from the database for any one query. No maximum = **-1**.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **newLibPath** | Should include all R library paths where R packages were installed. In our installation, they are: **c(“/usr/local/pkgs/Rpackages”,oldLibPath)**, since we installed additional R libraries under **/usr/local/pkgs/Rpackages**. Note that the **oldLibPath** needs to be included in this variable. |

1.  AQ Network Input File

In addition to the analysis input files which are script specific, AMET
makes use of the input file
**$AMET/scripts\_analysis/aqExample/Network.input**. This file allows
all of the network-specific processing to be handled in one location,
and allows for easier addition of new networks into the analysis
scripts.

1.  AQ Variables-Network Mapping

We provide below a mapping between monitoring networks, frequency (of
observations), and chemical species that are included in the observed
datasets, and that can be used in the model evaluation scripts. The
units of all these variables were provided already in Section 4.2.
