The files that contain "-config" must be updated with system and user
specific information before the AMET-AQ system will fuction properly.
The information should be available from the system adminstrator, or
whomever setup MySQL, R, AMET and Perl.

The ".conf" files are configuration files that defines the translation
b/w various MET models and the MADIS observation variables.  If you
are running MM5 without the PX surface model, you should use the
"nonPX" version.  All MCIP output should use the MCIP version.
