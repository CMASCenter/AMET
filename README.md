Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool

The Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) (Gilliam et al., 2005) is a
suite of software designed to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of
meteorological and air quality models. AMET matches the model output for
particular locations to the corresponding observed values from one or
more networks of monitors. These pairings of values (model and
observation) are then used to statistically and graphically analyze the
modelâ~@~Ys performance.

More specifically, AMET is currently designed to analyze outputs from
the PSU/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5), the Weather Research and Forecasting
(WRF) model, and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, as
well as Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP)-postprocessed
meteorological data (surface only).

The AMET Git archive is organized with each official public release stored as a branch on the main CMASCenter/AMET repository.
To check out code from the AMET Git archive, specify the branch (i.e. version number) and issue the following command from within
a working directory on your server:

git clone -b 1.2 https://github.com/CMASCenter/AMET.git

This command shows how to check out CMAQ v1.2 codes and scripts.  

The release versions of CMAQ that are currently available on Git Hub include:

* [v1.3 (June 2017)](https://github.com/CMASCenter/AMET/tree/1.3)
* [v1.2 (May 2008)](https://github.com/CMASCenter/AMET/tree/1.2)

Sample model and observation data for testing the AMET installation are available from the CMAS Center Software Clearinghouse. From http://www.cmascenter.org, select Download -> Software -> AMET and choose the version to get the sample data.
